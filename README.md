Class_Matrix_H
==============
The 'matrix' class aims at providing the basic operations involving matrices,
which can be used in C++ programs. It makes the programmer easy to realize the
mathematical operations as normally done  when solving by hand. With 'matrix'
its now less tiring to perform calculations on large matrices.

The class "matrix" provides the matrix operations:
* Addition
* Subtraction
* Multiplication (matrices)
* Multiplication (scalar)
* Inverse
* Determinant
* Covariance
* Append (horizontal)
* Append (vertical)
* Shorthand Addition
* Shorthand Subtraction
* Shorthand Multiplication (matrices)
* Shorthand Multiplication (scalar)
